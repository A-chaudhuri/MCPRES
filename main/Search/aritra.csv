The device  consists of several layers of flexible electronic components,  including  sensors  measuring  deformation  of  the  device.  Users  interact  with  this  device  by  a  combination  of  bending and 2D position control. Gummi explores physical  interaction  techniques  and  screen  interfaces  for  such  a  device. Its graphical user interface facilitates a wide range of  interaction tasks, focused on browsing of visual information.  We implemented both hardware and softwa",0,3376.981247962157,36274,57,3
