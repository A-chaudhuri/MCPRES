Thus, the bridge between the mathematical sciences and other disciplines is heavily traveled. The corre  spondingly increased dialog between the disciplines has led to the establishment of the series  Interdisciplinary Applied Mathematics.  The purpose of this series is to meet the current and future needs for the interaction between various science and technology areas on the one hand and mathematics on the other.

MAY  1 1.  1968   5 25   Towards  a Theoretical  Biology   by  C.  H.  WADDINGTON  Institute of Animal Genetics,  Edinburgh   Two  symposia  on  theoretical  biology  were  held  in  1966  and  1967  at  the  instigation  of  the  International  Union  of  Biological  Sciences.  The  meetings  were  organized  by  Professor Waddington, and  in  this  article  he  outlines  some  of  the  points  discussed  at  the  meetings.  The essays arising from  the  first  symposium  have recently  been pub cid 173  lished  under  the  title  Towards  a  Theoretical  Biology.   THEORETICAL  physics  is  a  well  recognized  discipline,  and  there  are  departments  and  professorships  devoted  to  the  subject  in  many  universities.  Moreover,  it  is  widely  accepted  that  theories  of  the  nature  of  the  physical  universe  have  profound  consequences  for  problems  of  general philosophy.
