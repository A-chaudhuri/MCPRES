In this paper, we study energy ef cient precoding for coordinated multi point  CoMP  transmission for HetNets. We formulate a problem that maximizes the energy ef ciency under the constraints of individual date rate requirement from each user, maximal transmit power of each base station  BS , and zero forcing  ZF  for a HetNet where the macro BS cooperates with multiple pico BSs. We then simplify the problem with the help of the practical topology of HetNets where the macro BS cooperates with each of the pico",50,155146.20823092625,9522744,59,2

A total of 394 subjects 40 years of age or older with chronic, stable, symptomatic IC received cilostazol 100 mg twice daily, 50 mg twice daily, or placebo for 24 weeks.
